The automated summary that [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanalonso/) created for me said: "_Experienced Project Manager with a demonstrated history of working in the internet industry_", so it must be true.

Senior professional with 19 years of experience in software development in different fields: consultancy, e-commerce, start-ups, academic research, R+D and videogames, half of them in project management roles.
