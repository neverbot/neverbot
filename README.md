### Hi! I'm IvÃ¡n Alonso / @neverbot ðŸ‘‹

The automated summary that [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanalonso/) created for me said: "_Experienced Project Manager with a demonstrated history of working in the internet industry_", so it must be true.

Senior professional with 20 years of experience in software development in different fields: consulting, e-commerce, start-ups, academic research, R+D and videogames, half of them in hands-on project management roles.

Take a look at my [CV/Developer Story](https://www.getmanfred.com/profile/neverbot) at manfred or, if you are a robot, in json format in my [cv repository](https://github.com/neverbot/cv).

I currently work at [gamelearn](https://github.com/gamelearn) as a _senior engineering manager / backend architect / developer experience advocate_, using mainly a full javascript stack. In some of my free time I like to mingle with open source videogame _things_:

* I developed [okinawa.js](https://github.com/okinawajs/okinawa.js), my own 2D javascript game engine, which powered [tenths](https://kids.sngular.com/repository) of mini serious games in the *pixie.es* programming learning platform for kids, now [sngular kids](https://kids.sngular.com/).
* My itch for vintage [online muds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) is tickled with the [maldorne](https://maldorne.org/) platform/organization, where I host several vintage [games](https://maldorne.org/games/), and develop my own games and mudlib: [Hexagon](https://github.com/houseofmaldorne/hexagon).
